# # Louise's Crowdfunding Campaign :

Louise has started crowdfunding campaign to fund her first ever play "FEVER" and her estimate to fund this project is over $10000.00.
She is trying to fund her project by starting a campaign and fundraising in different projects.
As per my analysis the highest successful projects were in the month of May-July and then it started falling down.
Also as mentioned earlier campaign had different projects but the most successful as per my analysis is the Theater Category and in that
plays were most successful.I further noticed that the least successful was Food category.


## Purpose of Project:

The purpose of this campaign is to fundraise for her first ever play "Fever" for which she started working on analysing many different campaign projects which were organized in different countries. We'll further see how successful was her campaign and in which country and what month she succeeded the most with the help of charts and graphs.

## Analysis & Challenges :

With the help of Excel functions I started analysing the data for Louise's crowdfunding campaign.
The very first step I did is organize the data so that it can be more easily understood and, therefore, generate insights that will help Louise's project. 
I accomplished this task by sorting filtering and formatting, and by freezing specific columns and rows. the quick view of the same is as below:

In the above image the Deadline and Launched_at columns contain Unix timestamps rather than dates in a standard format which i changed using the timstamp converter tool provided.
Further i managed to use the conditional formatting to to automatically apply a preselected color to the cell. So as you can see the outcome column has 4 categories - Successful/Failed/Cancelled/Live where i used conditional formatting color code category to provide Louise the visual presentation of the data in the worksheet with information at a glance.
